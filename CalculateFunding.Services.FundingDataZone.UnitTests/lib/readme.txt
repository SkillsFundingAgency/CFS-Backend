The published nuget package is missing support for QuerySingleOrDefaultAsync calls which we use but there was a PR waiting on being merged into master with these features
so I've cloned the PR repo for us to get those features until the project owner catches up

https://github.com/oppewala/Moq.Dapper is the PR repo

the main project is at https://github.com/UnoSD/Moq.Dapper
